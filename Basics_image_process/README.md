# Basic Image Processing: Color to Grayscale

This project demonstrates a simple image processing task: converting a colored image into a grayscale image using Python.

## Objective
- Understand how to read an image.
- Convert the image from color (RGB) to grayscale.
- Visualize both the original and processed images.

## Approach
1. Read the image using OpenCV / Matplotlib.
2. Convert the image to grayscale.
3. Display and compare the results.
