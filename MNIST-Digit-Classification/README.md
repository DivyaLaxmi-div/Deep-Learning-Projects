# MNIST Digit Classification

This project is about classifying handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset using Deep Learning.

## Dataset
- The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
- Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

## Approach
- Preprocessed the images (normalization, reshaping).
- Built a Neural Network
- Trained the model on the MNIST dataset.
- Evaluated accuracy on test data.


## Requirements
- Python
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
