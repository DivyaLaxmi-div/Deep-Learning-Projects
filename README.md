# Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of my Deep Learning projects.  
Each project has its own folder with code, datasets (if small), and instructions.

## üìÇ Projects Included
- [MNIST Digit Classification](./MNIST-Digit-Classification)  
  A simple neural network / CNN model to classify handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) from the MNIST dataset.

- [MNIST Fashion Classification](./MNIST-Fashion-Classification)  
  A deep learning model to classify clothing items such as shirts, shoes, and bags from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

- [Basic Image Processing (Color ‚Üí Grayscale)](./Basic-Image-Processing)  
  Simple project demonstrating how to convert colored images into grayscale using Python and OpenCV.

- [Breast Cancer Classification](./Breast-Cancer-Classification)  
  A deep learning model to classify breast cancer cases (malignant/benign) using structured data.

- [CIFAR Image Classification](./CIFAR-Image-Classification)  
  A CNN-based model to classify images from the CIFAR dataset (10 different classes).

- [ANN Churn Prediction](./ANN-Churn-Prediction)  
  A neural network model to predict customer churn based on customer data and behavior.

- [Fake News Prediction](./Fake-News-Prediction)  
  A deep learning model to detect fake news articles using NLP techniques and text classification.

*(More projects will be added soon...)*
